What We Need: 
    Design cards 
        Pull Title and Desc from API
    An array that keeps tracked of hit cards 
    An API that we can grab images from 
    A counter for the current score that doesn't refresh on rerender
        (use effect OR just keep score in parent so it never rerende)
    A tracker to keep track of the highest score 

Basic Logic: 
    API: 
        Grab the first 50 images and store them in their own array
        Render 10 different images 
        Onclick 
            Check if the array already contains the picture 
            If it does, compare the current score to high score, then set current score to zero
            Re render the pictures 


Onclick Logic
    First make an empty array for the choices and store it outside of the App 
    What it needs to do: 
        check if the selected picture is already in the array
        if it is {
                check the score to the previous high score
        } else {
                add a point to the board 
        }

    - start with it updating the score by using a state in the App component
